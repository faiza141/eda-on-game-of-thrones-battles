# EDA GAME OF THRONES BATTLES
This project provides an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of battles from the Game of Thrones universe using the official dataset of battles fought between the Great Houses of Westeros. The goal is to uncover interesting patterns, battle strategies, and historical insights that shaped the outcome of the wars.


# Key Findings:

Kings & House Dynamics:

Most active attacker king: Robb Stark
Most active defender king: Joffrey/Tommen Baratheon
Robb Stark led the most battles and had a strong win rate as an attacker.

Battle Outcomes:

Attacker victories: ~59%
Defender victories: ~41%
Attacking generally resulted in a higher chance of success, potentially due to initiative and planning.

Battle Types:

Most common: Pitched battle
Other types: Ambush, siege, razing
Pitched battles had a relatively balanced outcome rate, while ambushes often favored attackers.

Regions Involved:

Most battles took place in the Riverlands, followed by The North and The Westerlands.
These regions were strategic and central to political conflicts.

Commanders:

Most featured commanders: Robb Stark, Jaime Lannister, Roose Bolton
Multiple battles lacked commander data, limiting deeper comparisons.

Army Size Impact:

Larger army size did not always guarantee a win.
Correlation between army size and outcome was weak, suggesting leadership and strategy were more decisive.
